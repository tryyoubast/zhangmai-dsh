# identity/ — shared identity

## Summary

The identity group provides anonymous installation correlation and multi-user authentication primitives. The authentication package is server-side and owns password/token lifecycle contracts; it does not expose database credentials or raw token persistence to callers.

## Packages

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| [`anonymous-user-id`](anonymous-user-id/README.md) | Gives every harness home one anonymous id that telemetry, feedback, and DeepSeek requests attach to their records, so records from one installation can be recognized without identifying the user |
| [`user-auth`](user-auth/README.md) | Provides Argon2id password hashing, email verification/reset lifecycle seams, opaque session/refresh tokens, and EdDSA access-token primitives |
